# redux-thunk examples

[`redux-thunk`](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) is middleware that allows the return of a function in addition to objects normally returned by [`redux`](https://redux.js.org/). This makes it possible to also use asynchronous actions in the redux store. This repo contains a number of examples taken from video tutorials and with different use cases.
