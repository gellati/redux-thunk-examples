# Redux-thunk in webform

The project exemplifies the use of `redux-thunk` in a React webform.

Install the dependencies:

Now open a browser in `http://localhost:8080/`.

## TODO

There is a warning message given in the browser console when the number of input fields for adding a user is more than one.

See [this](https://goshakkk.name/controlled-vs-uncontrolled-inputs-react/) for some background information on the problem (although it did not solve the issue).
